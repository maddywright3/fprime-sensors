# XBee::XBeeManager

## 1. Introduction

`XBee::XBeeManager` is an FÂ´ component that implements the `Svc.Com` interface for communications management for XBee radio modules. It implements
passing data through the radio via a ByteStreamDriver (UART), as well as a commanding mode for the XBee modules (`+++`, `ATxx` commands etc.).

## 2. Assumptions

The `XBee::XBeeManager` assumes that:
- An XBee radio is connected via a UART/ByteStream driver
- The XBee radio is configured to respond to AT commands in command mode
- The radio supports the standard XBee AT command set (ATNI, ATED, ATCN, etc.)
- The underlying driver provides reliable data transmission and reception

## 4. Design

The `XBee::XBeeManager` component implements a state machine-based approach to manage XBee radio communications.
It operates in different modes: **passthrough mode** for normal data transmission and command modes for radio configuration and queries.

The component maintains a state machine for command mode operations:

The component interfaces with a `Drv::ByteStreamDriverModel` for low-level UART communication:
